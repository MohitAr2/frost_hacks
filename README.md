# Online Trial Room Project

This project aims to create an online trial room where users can try on clothes virtually. 

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: We use Beautiful Soup in Python for web scraping to gather data about clothes from various websites.
- **Server**: We use React.js to host the server.
- **3D Modeling**: We use Blender to create a 3D model of a stickman and fit the clothes onto it.
- **Size Settings**: We aim to provide size settings from all companies.
- **Social Features**: Users can share their data with friends to see how clothes fit.
- **AR Integration**: We plan to integrate with Snapchat's AR features.
- **Accessibility**: We aim to add features for colorblind users and others with accessibility needs.
- **Returns**: We plan to provide a feature for handling returns.
- **Brand Search**: Users can search for clothes from small-scale brands.

## Future Plans

We plan to automate more features in the future, such as automated selection of clothes to be shown based on user preferences. For now, we are focusing on showing how this can be done manually.
